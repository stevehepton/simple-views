# simple-views
A simple framework to create dynamic single page web applications with view selection using id / hash identifier

Inspired by the hashchange event triggered in JavaScript when the URL's hash has changed (for example: page.html#foo to page.html#bar)

Browser support is widespread, see: http://caniuse.com/#feat=hashchange

Very often the simple solutions are the best
